In an effort to keep the core as lean as possible, all non-essential functionality has been abstracted out into separate modules.

Optional modules will live here whilst SocketStream 0.4 is in development.

All modules that make the grade will eventually be released to npm and have separate repos.

Tip: Run `npm_link_all.sh` to run `sudo npm link` in each dir.
